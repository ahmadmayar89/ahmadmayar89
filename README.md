👋 Hey, I'm Ahmad Rashid  
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a final-year cybersecurity student with hands-on experience in SOC operations, penetration testing, and cloud security. I build security tools, analyze network traffic, and automate defensive workflows. I enjoy participating in CTFs, contributing to open-source security projects, and exploring the latest trends in cybersecurity.
